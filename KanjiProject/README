Trying it out
-------------

You can try out this recogniser using the applet here:

http://live.leafdigital.com/kanji/


Using binaries
--------------

If you just want to use this library, grab the binary jar files. 

There are two files: kanjirecog.[version].jar and 
kanjirecog.[version].javadoc.jar.

* You only need the main jar file (add it to your application) to use this
  utility.
  
* The second jar file contains the javadoc documentation. If you add this
  in the 'attached javadoc' field for the library in an IDE such as Eclipse,
  your IDE will be able to automatically show the documentation for this class.

The jar files do not include the example application/applet in
com.leafdigital.kanji.example. Obtain the source files for this directly.


Build instructions
------------------

If you want to build this project, download the source using Git or the
GitHub download option.

Once you have downloaded the source, just change to the directory with this
file in and run 'ant'. The default build.xml file will build the project.

Examine build.xml if you want to change where it puts temporary data or the
resulting output files.


Documentation
-------------

Please look inside the javadoc (or the source package-info.java) to see
how to use this library to recognise characters. You might also want to
look at the source for the example applet, although it's a bit of a mess.


Android version
---------------

An Android app based on this library is included in this repository in
the branch 'android'.
